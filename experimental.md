# Latest Trends in AI

## 1. Agentic AI

AI systems are evolving from passive responders to **autonomous agents** that can plan, act, and reflect, integrating with tools and workflows.

## 2. Multimodal Models

Models that process **text, images, audio, and video together** are becoming mainstream, enabling richer interactions and cross-domain reasoning.

## 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG improves factual accuracy by combining **search with generation**, grounding model outputs in real-time or domain-specific data.

## 4. AI in Edge and On-Device

Running models directly on **edge devices** (phones, IoT, cars) boosts privacy and reduces latency, making AI more accessible.

## 5. AI Safety and Alignment

Growing focus on **safety, interpretability, and governance**, with standards and protocols (like MCP) shaping secure AI ecosystems.
